What I learned during this project (July 2021):
- Attempting to replicate set specifications
- Visualising elemnents of a layout
- Formatting images in a layout
- JavaScript alert
- Checkbox and input fields

**Link to work**: [First static React page with navbar, list and footer, all styled with CSS ](https://criminy-git.github.io/React-Static-App/) (hopefully will update code shortly after I commented out previous code)
